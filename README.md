# Thinkful-DS-Fundamentals
Jupyter Notebook lessons from the Data Science Fundamentals section.   And required projects.

### Prep capstone
   I was not happy with this project and will be updating it as I improve my data skills.  I over thought the project and the first graph should not have been a histogram for what I was trying to relay.  However I did get good feedback from my reviewer and plan on implementing it.  But I plan on applying it more to future capstones and not agonizing over this project.
